Working on assignment by following the guideline and instructions
Had knowledge of git beforehand but with this additional guideline and inatructions it was easier navigating and exploring. Most ttimes I do use git commands in my IDES terminal directly but during the course of this assignment I used the default CLI  which was fun with the keywor "echo"
Github is good for collaboration and assigning of task with other team members
Rounding up I didn't face many challenges as I was used to Gitthub just had to follow the instructions given by the Tutor
